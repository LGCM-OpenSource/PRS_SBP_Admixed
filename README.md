# PRS_SBP_Admixed

This repository contains data from the paper "...", working with GWAS derivation in the UKB dataset, PRS train and validation with both UKB and higly admixed brazilian population.  
The GWAS summary is available at "...GWAS catalog" and the PRS in "...PGS repository".  
Here we made available the PRS extrapolation and calculation with plink (for all 3 populations) alongside the phenotype used (SBP - SBP_Med_adjusted) and covariables (Age, Sex, BMI and first four PCs).  

## Phenotype columns
1. SBP_Med_adjusted -- Indicates the Systolic Blood Presure after Medication use correction
>SBP was corrected adding 15mmHg if the sample made use of Blood Pressure medication  

2. DBP_Med_adjusted -- Indicates the Diastolic Blood Presure after Medication use correction
>DBP was corrected adding 10mmHg if the sample made use of Blood Pressure medication
